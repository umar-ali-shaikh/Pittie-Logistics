            <h5>Mr. Aditya Pittie</h5>
            <p>Managing Director, Pittie Group</p>
            <p>
              Mr. Aditya Pittie, Managing Director of Pittie Group, represents
              a new generation of dynamic Indian entrepreneurs who are
              reshaping traditional business models with vision, innovation,
              and agility. Under his leadership, the Pittie Group has evolved
              into a diversified conglomerate with strong footholds in
              consumer products, logistics, and media. An alumnus of King’s
              College, London, where he earned a degree in Management &
              Leadership, Aditya’s global perspective and sharp business
              acumen have laid the foundation for the Group’s transformation.
              His leadership is marked by a focus on sustainable growth,
              operational excellence, and an unwavering commitment to quality.
              At the heart of the Group’s diversification is Pittie Consumer,
              which has emerged as a fast-growing force in India’s FMCG
              sector. Guided by Aditya’s consumer-first vision, the division
              has successfully created trusted brands that blend heritage,
              innovation, and everyday relevance. From spiritual and
              devotional essentials that bring authenticity to daily worship
              to home cleaning and care solutions that elevate household
              hygiene standards, Pittie Consumer’s portfolio reflects a deep
              understanding of Indian consumers and their evolving needs.
              Supporting this growth is the Group’s robust logistics division,
              which Aditya has strengthened into a nationwide supply chain
              network with modern warehousing and a presence across 700+ pin
              codes and 3,500+ touchpoints. This integration of manufacturing,
              branding, and logistics ensures quality, consistency, and
              efficiency across every business vertical. Driven by strategic
              innovation, a culture of excellence, and a deep sense of
              purpose, Aditya Pittie continues to steer the Pittie Group
              toward sustainable and consumer-centric growth, reinforcing its
              reputation as a forward-thinking and values-driven group.
